    # `snok/install-poetry` seems to be minimal yet complete, and really just calls out to
    # Poetry's default install script, which feels correct. I pin the Poetry version here
    # because Poetry does occasionally change APIs between versions and I don't want my
    # actions to break if it does.

    # The key configuration value here is `virtualenvs-in-project: true`: this creates the
    # venv as a `.venv` in your testing directory, which allows the next step to easily
